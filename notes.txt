Circuit program

---


This program is meant to allow for interactive construction, verification, and simulation of circuits.

The plan is for both logic gates (and/or/not/xor/etc.) and cmos (nmos/pmos) to be supported, as well as with methods of linking the two.

SRAM also needs to be supported of course.


Circuits should be able to be grouped into modules, wires grouped into buses.
